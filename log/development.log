The possibility of a return to the $245,000 range seems remote for the following reasons. First, even at current prices, affordability is more than double the levels of two and three years ago. This should continue to drive demand and prevent a significant decline in home prices. Second, despite recent increases in inventory levels (6.3 months in February), inventory in California was still below the long-run average of 7 months. Historically, inventory levels below that threshold have fueled year-to-year price gains. This would suggest that as long as inventory remains relatively low, prices should remain stable over the coming months, all else being equal.\r\n\r\nCollectively, these observations imply that the market should see prices stabilize or edge up over the foreseeable future, yet there is still a lot of uncertainty about the rest of the year. For one thing, it remains to be seen how the housing market will sustain itself once the federal Homebuyer Tax Credits end on June 30th. Moreover, there are long-standing concerns about a second wave of foreclosures and how it will impact housing market values. Recent changes to the HAMP loan modification program, including principal forgiveness, and similar changes to the loan modification programs of major banks, along with growing evidence that the California market has shown improvement in recent months, the likelihood the housing market will experience a double dip is small.', '2010-05-13 06:18:09', 0)[0m
